    Because we're referencing the variables that we created outside the 
    function. We use "var" to create new variables, but in this case, we want to 
    update the value of variables that already exist. 
    Using the var keyword would 
    create a new enemyHealth variable inside the fight function, meaning that the 
    enemyHealth variable we created at the top of the file and outside of the function, 
    would be unaffected. This is called scoping a variable. */
